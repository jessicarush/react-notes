> In an upcoming minor, weâ€™re planning to add a new component called [`<Offscreen>`](https://react.dev/blog/2022/06/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-june-2022#offscreen).

**Update:** This is now included as experimental feature but is now called [`<Activity>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity#noun-labs-1201738-(2)).
