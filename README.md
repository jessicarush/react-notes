# react notes


## description

In the same spirit as my [python notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/python-notes) and [javascript notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/javascript-notes), I'll be using this repo to collect my notes and examples as I learn React. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. The data directory contains resources for some of the examples. My training is self-guided through the use of docs, text books and online courses/resources listed below.
